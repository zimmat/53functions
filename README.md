# 53functions

You can think of 53 functions as small bite size programming challanges which aim to prepare coders to do Code Katas. Each coder will have to clone this repository and start to commit their implementation of the functions. A central CI instance will run their functions and give them a score for each function based on how many tests are passing. These functions are not to be completed on one sitting, but is to be completed on the coders own time.

> Fifty-three is the 16th prime number. It is also an Eisenstein prime, and a Sophie Germain prime. The sum of the first 53 primes is 5830, which is divisible by 53, a property shared by few other numbers.

You should:
* fork this repo
* link your forked copy of the repo to the upstream repo to get changes easily 
* To see how to do that have a look here: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/
* regularly update from upstream to check for changes
* use TDD
	* Write the first 5 functions your own framework at first - the one you created in the Codex Setup
	* start looking at [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/)
		* Rewrite the tests for the first 5 functions using Qunit. 
	* From now on use Qunit 
	* Setup a [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) and start monitoring your tests
* commit to GIT regularly

# These things count:
* regular commits
* testable code
* passing tests

# The functions

The function name and the file name should be the same

For example for hello.js the function should look like this:

```
function hello(){
	// your code goes here
}
```

Each function should have a test file called functionname_test.js

For ```hello.js``` it should be called ```hello_test.js```


> If any of these function specifications don't make sense, let's discuss, clarify and change it.

34|calc_all.js|can add, subtract, multiply or divide 2 numbers - parameters are the symbol followed by the 2 numbers
35|calc_chain.js|has and add, subtract, multiply and divide method - methods should be chainable and it should be possible to do Calculator.add(1,2).multiply(9).value() should equal 27
36|paper_rock.js|allows one to play rock paper scissors * = rock, # = paper, x = scissors, it should be a constructor function that take in number of games that will be played. var game1 =  new RockPaperScissors(3) - it should have a playerOne and a playerTwo functions, a play and a score method.
37|factors2.js|find all the factors of 2 that is less than the number specified by the parameter
38|factors_2_or_7.js|find all the factors of 2 or 7 that is less than the number specified by the parameter

48|multiples.js| that can count in multiples, it takes a parameter of the multiple to count in and have a .count() method to give the next number and a list function to return all the numbers that was already counted.
49|cricket.js| that solves this riddle: The common field cricket chirps in direct proportion to the current tem­perature. Adding 40 to the number of times a cricket chirps in a minute, then dividing by 4, gives us the temperature (in Fahrenheit degrees). Write a program that accepts as input the number of cricket chirps in fifteen seconds, then outputs the current temperature to the nearest half degree. http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/101/HomeworkProblems.html
50|filter.js| takes a list of values and a filter function that can filter the list of values - the filtered result should be returned by the function. This function should be able to filter any kind of data, it shouldn't care about the data.
